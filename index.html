  <h3>I have been developing a passion for web design ever since I started studying at Thinkful.</h3>
  <img src="images/computer_surfing_sm.gif" alt="a computer surfing" />
  <p> I find that coding is simmilar to music in many ways. It is all about putting a lot of small detailed things together to produce a larger product.</p>
  <p>During my time in the Thinkful program I have been seeing many paralells to learning music and coding webdesign and I have been very happy with the material I have learned how to produce. </p>

      <h2>Project Name</h2>
    <h3>Online metronome</h3>
    <p>This is a metronome that can be used by anyone who has an internet connection.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="item">
      <h3>What is this project about?</h3>
      <p> A metronome is an incredibly useful tool when practicing any kind of music, and having access to a metronome anywhere you have an internet connection is extremely helpful.</p>
      <p> The skills used in creating this project are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>using css and html to create a blinking light that synchs to a timecode</li>
        <li>using javascript to play a beep that synchs to the same timecode</li>
        <li>using an html and css interface to adjust the rate at which the metronome beeps</li>
      </ol>
    </article>
    <article class = "item">
      <h3>Who is this project for and why did I choose this project?</h3>
      <p> This project is for people who need quick acess to a metronome and do not want to install any apps or programs to their phone or computer.</p>
    <br>
      <p> I chose to create this project becuase I have found myself needing a metronome and do not want to download an app to use it. It is also very helpful in teaching situations where you need a metronome on the fly.</p>
